# qtile-dotfiles
My first Arch Linux custom desktop, made from scratch with QtileWM.
If you want to use these dotfiles, please keep in mind that you need every package installed.
I will keep on adding commits to this repo as I change stuff in my personal desktop.
Feel free to change any config file to your heart's content.
