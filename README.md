# qtile-dotfiles
My first custom desktop, made from scratch with QtileWM.
If you want to use these dotfiles, please keep in mind that you need every package installed.
Fonts used are JetBrains Mono Nerd Font and Fira Code Nerd Font.
I will keep on adding commits to this repo as I change stuff in my personal desktop.
